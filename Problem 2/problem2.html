    <h1>My Morning Routine</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Wake up and wonder about my life.</li>
        <li>Check my cellphone to see what possible good news is happening in the world; once again, nothing new.</li>
        <li>Finally leave my bed to then take care of my little baby Manny.</li>
        <li>After he is taken care of, I go ahead and start to figure out what I am going to eat or do for myself.</li>
        <li>Once I figure that out, the beginning part of my day is complete.</li>
        <p>The most important step in this whole list is taking care of Manny. He is a living creature and he is unable to do anything without the assistance of a human.</p>
    </ol>
